**No comparison, no judgement. Enjoy the moment and just have fun.**

**Easily hide or display the leaderboard using an image of your choice or a dark screen. For BS 1.18.0+**

## How To Use
- Unzip and place entire contents into your BS directory
- To use your own image, place any PNG file in `UserData/BeHereNow` and name it `image.png`. For best results, choose an image with an aspect ratio around 1.33:1 (see included template)
- Save multiple images in the directory and rename to swap (must close game before swapping)
- To use the blank dark screen, use the included template `image.png` or another transparent image and toggle on `Hide Ranks`
- There must be an `image.png`. Not having it will break the mod.
- Requires BS_Utils, BSML. Make sure you have the latest version of BS Utils specific to your game version. If the screen appears anywhere without the leaderboard, check and update your BS Utils
